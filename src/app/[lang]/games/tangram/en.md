Tangram is an ancient Chinese puzzle game consisting of seven geometric pieces cut from a square: two large triangles, one medium triangle, two small triangles, one square, and one parallelogram. Players arrange these seven pieces to form various shapes such as animals, people, buildings, and more.

Tangram not only exercises spatial thinking abilities but also cultivates creativity and patience. For hundreds of years, it has remained a beloved puzzle game enjoyed by people worldwide.

## How to Use This Page

This interactive online Tangram experience allows you to drag the seven basic Tangram shapes from the right side to the central board. You can click and drag shapes on the board to change their positions, and once a shape is selected, you can rotate it 360Â° by dragging the black rotation control point.

To make moving multiple pieces easier, you can hold down the Shift key while clicking several shapes to manipulate them simultaneously. When multiple shapes are selected, moving any one of them will move all selected pieces together.

## Tips for Playing Tangram

When playing with Tangram, I recommend not giving up easily. Try different combinations - you might be surprised by what you can create!

- Some shapes may require flipping pieces to complete, so experiment with different arrangements
- For beginners, it's best to start with simpler shapes like triangles and squares
- As you become more skilled, challenge yourself with more complex patterns like animals and people
- Though Tangram consists of only seven pieces, they can be combined to form thousands of different patterns

If you have ideas for new shapes, feel free to share them with me, and I'll help you bring them to life.
