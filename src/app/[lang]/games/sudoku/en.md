## Sudoku Rules

Sudoku, a puzzle game originating from Japan, has become one of the most popular logic puzzles worldwide. It's not just a pastime but an excellent way to exercise your brain. The charm of Sudoku lies in its **simple rules and deep strategy**. The game is played on a 9x9 grid, with the goal of filling each empty cell so that:

- Every row contains all numbers from 1 to 9, without repetition
- Every column contains all numbers from 1 to 9, without repetition
- Every 3x3 sub-grid contains all numbers from 1 to 9, without repetition

Although based on numbers, **Sudoku doesn't require complex mathematical calculations**. It tests your **logical thinking and concentration**.

Additionally, there's an undo feature supporting up to 3 steps of undo. Here are some Sudoku playing strategies:

- Observe the initial layout: At the start of the game, some cells are already filled with numbers.
- Analyze empty spaces: Use existing numbers to deduce possible options for empty cells.
- Fill step by step: Start with the most certain cells and gradually complete the entire grid.
- Check for conflicts: Ensure that the numbers you enter don't conflict with those in the same row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid.
- Repeated reasoning: As the grid fills up, new clues will constantly emerge, helping you solve more puzzles.

Some advanced techniques:

1. Elimination method: Focus on cells with fewer options. By eliminating impossible numbers, you can often find the only correct answer.
2. Candidate notation: Mark all possible numbers in empty cells. This method can help you quickly locate the correct answer in later stages.
3. Block analysis: Divide the 9x9 grid into three 3x3 large blocks. Analyzing the relationships between these blocks often reveals new breakthroughs.
4. "Sole candidate" method: If a number has only one possible position in a row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid, it must be placed there.
